<p>Hi, I am Vivek.</p>
<p>I am a developer based out of Kerala, India. Addicted to computers from a young age, I have been developing small micro-controller based programs to complex enterprise applications for some time now. I see technology as an &ldquo;enabler&rdquo; &amp; was always marvelled by the progress, we as a species, abled to achieve using it.</p>
<p>In the last 5 years, I have co-created two startups, <a href="https://codeister.com"target="_blank">Codeister Technologies</a> &amp; <a href="https://spoon.money"target="_blank">Spoon.Money</a>. My first venture, Codeister Technologies, was started during my college days. Our product was an automated expense manager app called <mark>SYM (Save Your Money)</mark>. During my final semester, our team was acqui-hired by a US-based startup called <a href="https://carestack.com"target="_blank">CareStack</a>. I was part of the CareStack engineering team for around 9-months when I decided to quit and be a founding member of Spoon. At Spoon, we are on a mission to provide financial services to the next billion.</p>
