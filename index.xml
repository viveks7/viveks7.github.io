      <description>Hi, I am Vivek.
I am a developer based out of Kerala, India. Addicted to computers from a young age, I have been developing small micro-controller based programs to complex enterprise applications for some time now. I see technology as an &amp;ldquo;enabler&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; was always marvelled by the progress, we as a species, abled to achieve using it.
In the last 5 years, I have co-created two startups, Codeister Technologies &amp;amp; Spoon.</description>
